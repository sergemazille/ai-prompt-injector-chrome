# Privacy Policy for AI Prompt Injector

*Last updated: August 2025*

## Overview

AI Prompt Injector is committed to protecting your privacy. This browser extension is designed with privacy-first principles: **we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers**. All functionality operates locally on your device.

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

- ❌ Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Usage analytics or telemetry
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Device information
- ❌ Cookies or tracking identifiers
- ❌ Any form of user behavior data

### What Is Stored Locally

The extension stores the following data **exclusively on your device** using the browser's local storage API:

- **Prompts**: Your custom prompt templates
- **Labels**: Titles for your prompts
- **Tags**: Organizational tags you create
- **Favorites**: Your favorite prompt selections

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to the developer or any third party
- Can be exported/imported by you at any time
- Is automatically deleted when you uninstall the extension

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires minimal permissions to function:

### `activeTab` Permission
- **Purpose**: To inject prompts into the current AI chat interface when you click "Insert"
- **Scope**: Only accesses the tab where you explicitly trigger the action
- **Duration**: Access ends immediately after prompt insertion

### `storage` Permission
- **Purpose**: To save your prompts locally on your device
- **Scope**: Uses chrome.storage.local API (device-only storage)
- **Control**: You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings

### `scripting` Permission
- **Purpose**: To execute the content script that inserts prompts into text fields
- **Scope**: Only runs on supported AI websites listed in the manifest
- **Timing**: Only executes when you click "Insert" on a prompt

### Host Permissions
The extension requests access to specific AI chat websites:
- chatgpt.com
- claude.ai
- gemini.google.com
- chat.mistral.ai
- And other AI platforms listed in manifest.json

**Important**: The extension only interacts with these sites when you explicitly click "Insert" to add a prompt.
